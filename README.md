# RITA Flights Visualization
## by Adnan Sawas


## Dataset

The dataset is a collection of flights data from 2005 till 2008. Data is originally coming from the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS). BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are made available to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released.


## Summary of Findings

- Only years (2005 - 2009) were included in the analysis.
- There are 23 unique carriers.
- About 1.93% of flights were cancelled.
- Tha major reason of flights cancellation is because of the carrier then weather. These two reasons contribute to about 80% of cancelled flights.
- Year 2006 was the best year in terms of flight cancellation rate (1.7%)
- Most carriers tend to operate flights that are less than 1000 miles while only 5 carriers do operate very long flights (> 3500 miles).
- The most frequent flight route is between SAN and LAX. More than 26.9 K flights per year (that's about 73 flights per day!).
  - Flights with low delay tend to have more propbability of higher AirTime.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Although percentage of cancelled flights is only 1.93%, percentage of cancelled flights is almost stable over the yers. Year 2006 was the best perfomance year in terms of percentage of cancelled flights while year 2007 was the worst.
- Carriers distribution of operating short and long flights:
  - Most carriers tend to operate flights that are less than 1000 miles.
  - Carriers focusing only on short flights are: MQ, YV, OH, EV, OO, 9E, DH
  - Carriers UA, CO, B6. HP and TZ tend to have more diversed flights (short and long flights)
  - Carriers UA, DL, AA, NW and CO are the only carriers who operate very long flights (> 3500 miles)
- For departure delay and air time relation across carriers in the most frequesnt fligth which is (SAN -> LAX) flight:
  - Flights with low departure delay tend to have more propbability of higher AirTime (although this is actually very rare)
  - About 0.2% of flight have departure delay > 200 minutes. These flights have almost consistent air time of approximately 28 minutes
  - I think because the flight is very short, the effect of departure time on air time is not that obvious.
  - Another observation is that this flight is mostly operated by OO and MQ carriers.
